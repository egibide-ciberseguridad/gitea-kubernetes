/ I used to be a rebel in my youth.       \
|                                         |
| This cause... that cause... (chuckle) I |
| backed 'em ALL! But I learned.          |
| Rebellion is simply a device used by    |
| the immature to hide from his own       |
| problems. So I lost interest in         |
| politics. Now when I feel aroused by a  |
| civil rights case or a passport         |
| hearing... I realize it's just a        |
| device. I go to my analyst and we work  |
| it out. You have no idea how much       |
| better I feel these days.               |
